Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for AI-Powered Editor
Overview
I'll outline a structured approach to integrate AI suggestions into your editor, focusing on practical implementation steps.

Step 1: Set up AI service integration
Create an AI service wrapper in the backend:

Create a new file for AI service integration
Add API key management and environment configuration
Implement proxy endpoints for AI requests
Add new API endpoints to the server:

Text completion endpoint
Content improvement suggestions endpoint
Error handling and rate limiting
Step 2: Create frontend AI service client
Develop a service client to communicate with AI endpoints:

Create methods for different AI capabilities
Add request debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
Implement error handling and fallback options
Build a suggestion context manager:

Track editor context (surrounding text, document theme)
Manage suggestion history and preferences
Create intelligent prompts based on user's writing style
Step 3: Enhance the editor UI for AI suggestions
Create suggestion display components:

Inline ghost text for completions
Floating suggestion panel for longer content
Status indicators for AI processing
Add user controls for AI features:

AI assistance toggle button in toolbar
Suggestion acceptance/rejection mechanisms
Settings panel for AI preferences
Step 4: Integrate AI capabilities with the editor
Connect editor events to AI suggestion triggers:

Monitor typing pauses to request completions
Add right-click menu options for AI assistance
Create keyboard shortcuts for AI features
Implement suggestion application logic:

Insert completions at cursor position
Replace selected text with improvements
Highlight and annotate content issues
Step 5: Add user preference management
Create a settings interface:

Suggestion frequency preferences
Writing style and tone settings
Privacy controls and data usage options
Implement persistence for user preferences:

Store settings in local storage
Add backend storage option for cross-device consistency
Step 6: Optimize for performance and user experience
Implement efficient processing:

Use web workers for background processing
Cache frequent suggestions
Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities
Add analytics and improvement mechanisms:

Track suggestion acceptance rates
Gather anonymous usage patterns
Implement feedback collection
Detailed File Changes Required:
Server-side files:

Update server.js to add AI proxy endpoints
Create new aiService.js for API integration
Add configuration management for API keys
Frontend service files:

Create AIClient.js for API communication
Add SuggestionManager.js for context tracking
Implement UserPreferences.js for settings
UI Component files:

Update AIPoweredEditor.js to integrate AI features
Create SuggestionDisplay.js for UI elements
Add AISettingsPanel.js for user controls
Utility files:

Add promptEngineering.js for creating effective AI prompts
Create suggestionProcessing.js for handling AI responses
