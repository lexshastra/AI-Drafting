# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Running the Editor

To use the editor with document storage capabilities, you need to:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```
   npm install
   npm install express cors
   ```

2. **Start the backend server** (in one terminal):
   ```
   node src/server.js
   ```
   The server will run on http://localhost:5000

3. **Start the React app** (in another terminal):
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The app will open at http://localhost:3000

4. You should now be able to create and edit documents that will be saved to the server.

## Troubleshooting

If you see "Error creating new document: Failed to fetch" or similar errors:
- Make sure the server is running on http://localhost:5000
- Check that you've installed all required dependencies with `npm install express cors`
- Verify that the `documents` directory exists in the `src` folder and is writable
